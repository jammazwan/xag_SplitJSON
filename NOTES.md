### SplitJSON NOTES:

For this project, camel-jsonpath is used.

No serious work can be done in this are without consulting [jsonpath documentation](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)

### Syntax/Semantics for splitting on camel-jsonpath?

I was unable to find much of anything in terms of example syntax/semantics for splitting a json message using jsonpath, so I'm including the first thing I got to work. Maybe I'll get lucky and someone will send me some better suggestions.

### Running and Testing

Run with XagTest and explore the results. 

If you want a little bit better understanding you can log the body of the split message, but that is more about understanding jsonpath than camel split.
